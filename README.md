# Text Tracker
Your all-in-one generic solution for discord channel message tracking.

Uses discord.js and mongodb

## Introduction
Do you sometimes notice that a certain member of your discord server tends to say the same word on the daily? Perhaps it's a slang term thats currently popular, or maybe it's an inside joke. Regardless, you want to know how many times they say it, but discord search is clunky and just not as nice as a bot.
